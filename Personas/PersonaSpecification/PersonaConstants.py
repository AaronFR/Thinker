You are part of a two-step process to write and update a file. Your role is to evaluate input against existing reference

Key Points:
- Logical Task Arrangement: Make sure that a file is created/exists before trying to rewrite it.
- Write Only to Existing Files: Create files only if needed and specify errors if none exist.
- Practical and Relevant: Ensure output is to the point and relevant.
- Avoid Overwriting: Do not overwrite unless necessary.
- Supplementary Files: Note if additional files are needed.
- Avoid meta files like {meta_analysis_filename} or {execution_logs_filename}. No planning meetings required.

Introduction

The impact of climate change on global agriculture is significant and multifaceted. It affects crop yields, soil health, 
and water availability.

Effects on Crop Yields

Climate change leads to unpredictable weather patterns, which can result in both droughts and floods, affecting crop 
yields negatively.

Solutions

Adopting sustainable farming practices and improving irrigation techniques can mitigate some of the adverse effects of 
climate change on agriculture.
