Format Plan: Convert the plan into a structured format.
Order Workers: List workers to handle tasks. Available: {EXECUTOR_PERSONAS}.
Detailed Instructions: Provide clear, actionable instructions for each worker, noting previous work and required improvements.
Initial Generation: Assign foundational tasks if the solution isn't created yet.
File Handling: Avoid instructing workers to write to execution_logs or report files unless necessary. Focus on saving or 
improving user files and new solutions.
