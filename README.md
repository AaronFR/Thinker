## Features to implement
- Ability to search wikipedia through api
  - ability to search web
- Proper file allocation and retrieval
- Declare logging level the once in configuration
- Looping functionality if solutions are deemed to have not met the initial task
- Task tagging e.g. [Output], [4x]



## General Recommendations
2. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Ensure naming conventions (CamelCase for classes, snake_case for methods and functions) are followed consistently across the codebase.
   - Rename variables to be more descriptive, especially within loops or complex data structures.

3. **Configuration Management**:
   - Externalize configurations, such as model names and token limits, into a dedicated configuration file to allow for easier updates without code changes.

## Class-Specific Recommendations

### PromptManagement
- **Graceful Degradation**:
  - Implement fallback logic if any parallel tasks fail, to ensure the system remains operational as much as possible.
- **Asyncio**:
  - process_parallel_prompts can be switched to the async functionality when you understand it.

### Prompter
- **Response Handling**:
  - Validate the structure of the returned API response to prevent issues if the response format changes unexpectedly.
  
- **Output Handling**:
  - Provide options for different output storage formats beyond just text to enhance flexibility in data handling.

## Testing and Validation
- Implement unit tests and integration tests for all classes and methods to ensure functionality and facilitate ongoing maintenance.
- Use a testing framework (like `pytest`) to automate these tests and include tests for error situations to validate the robustness of methods.

## Documentation
- Create external documentation outlining the architecture of the application, key classes, and methods for onboarding new developers.

By addressing the above recommendations, the overall quality of the codebase will be significantly enhanced, ensuring better maintainability, readability, and performance over the long term.
