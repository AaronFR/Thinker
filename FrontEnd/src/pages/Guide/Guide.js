        in your day to day life and work. Without being ripped off by 'AI Hype' grifters.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been looking at AI since before gpt-2, before the hype and I've been thinking: "Okay cool.. is <i>this</i> it? 
      </p>
        <ul>
          Where can I use workflows of <b>multiple</b> prompts, not just one and only one at a time?
        </ul>
        <ul>
          Where can I, <i>you know</i>, use AI to help automate using AI??
        </ul>
        <ul>
          Where can I deeply customise how I interact with LLMs and how they respond to my prompts?
        </ul>
        <ul>
          Where uses a system to try and mitigate the inconsistencies and hallucinations of LLMs <i>intelligently</i>,
          instead of thinking we need to try and cram
          the entire, up to date human canon inside a statistical algorithm?
        </ul>
        <ul>
          Why do I have to deal with these limits and restrictions, why can't <i>I</i> set the limits?
        </ul>
        <ul>
          And where can I get them without having to pay for another damn subscription?
        </ul>
        <ul>
          There are products designed for enterprise, but where is something for the average person?
        </ul>
        
        
      <small>prefereably open source</small>

      <p>Eventually, I just got tired of wondering these questions and decided to take a shot at it myself!</p>



      <h2 className="centered">Okay, why should <i>I</i> care?</h2>
        <p>
          If you plan on using or even just experimenting with AI, The Thinker would be a great place to start because it's <b>pay as you go</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          No monthly subscription, no recurring fees, no qoutas. While your also provided with workflows and optional functions that can help
          you make the most of AI in your day to day.
        </p>

        <p>
          Prices will be our own costs per AI resource we pay for, plus a small percentage to pay for server costs and salary 
          (1% after beta, but for now its at cost -so at a loss).
        </p>
        <p>And if you want to use it locally and just use your own API keys you can.</p>

      <h3>Home Page</h3>
      <p>
        On the home page you'll see the typical LLM wrapper prompt box. When you make your first request that request will be Automatically
        categorised based on its contents -so you don't need to worry about organising your prior messages yourself. At the same time a persona
        (role) and workflow will be assigned.
      </p>
      <p>
        Different personas interpret responses and produce different responses based on their role. `Coder` Will work like a software developer given a coding ticket,
        `Writer`'s will act like writers creating an article and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Workflows dictate how responses and actions taken
      </p>
        <ul>
          Chat - Your typical prompt -{'>'} response
        </ul>
        <ul>
          Write - will write to a file name you suggest or come up with its own. The Writer persona can be asked to write a certain number of 'pages' for arbitrarily long documents
        </ul>
        <ul>
          For Each - Will process each file reference you select/upload individually. (Useful for improving on entire folders or working on many tasks at once)
        </ul>

        <h3>Settings</h3>
          <p>Here you can configure how the application will react in detail</p>
            <ul>User Interface</ul>
            <ul>
              Functionality - By default most features a few features are disabled, toggle them on if you want to try them out. Each function typically incurrs an additional cost:
              But background processes run on a seperate model from the main, one that's economical and fast while still competent (You can select which specfific model is used as the background model in settings), so they should be rather afforadable to run
            </ul>
            <ul>System Messages - These dictate how an LLM will respond to your prompt. You can customise nearly all system messages based on your preferences</ul>

        <h3>Messages</h3>
          <p>
            Here you'll see prior messages and files that have been created/uploaded, if you select on the bottom of a file or message you can select it, then its contents will be used as reference
            in your next prompt
          </p>
          <p>
            if you want to expand a file or prompt, just click on the text/file name respectively to expand the item
          </p>
