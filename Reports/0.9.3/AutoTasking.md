# Auto Tasks

So we're given up the pretension of running something vaguely within the orbit of an actual scientific test with measurable results for this report
and default to simple logging and note taking.

What I want to observe is how well the application takes to attempting individual software tasks/tickets.
I also want to see the utility of the Auto workflow for large numbers of files. Put my claim that it can run 'arbitrarily' many operations to the test.

To these ends I have included 20+ files in an auto workflow operation, each one pre-pended with a task, covering almost all existent planned features in the README.
I want to see where it fails, and it will fail, almost certainly, but where and why are useful to know for optimising the application.
For improving its ability to solve any given problem given to it.
Currently we know it struggles with complexity and most of these features (bar a few) are rather complex, but how can we reduce and ease this complexity?

If it can successfully implement even 20% of the pages included that's ~4 features. That's almost an entire update right there.

### 1 - Review Task

First stage is running auto on gpt-4o-mini and asking it if it thinks the task is possible, if it can improved and clarified,
and if any superfluous information can be removed.
The real purpose of this step is just to ensure that auto can execute a large payload of files without imploding in on top of itself
when running an actually expensive model.

Which it can.

So this did *surprisingly* well, I expected the expensive models like o1-mini to be confused and just produce garbage. But the vast majority of content output is useful *to some degree*.
It *did* fail at actually analysing the task itself on a meta level and suggesting improvements to the task file without doing the task itself.
But its been said before:

The words "Do NOT actually try and answer this task" contain the words " try and answer this task"

### 2 - Attempt Task

Completed @16:36 2025/01/13
Cost: $4.93 (Well the good news is that the openAi billing and your own estimates match almost exactly)

That's very high cost, I anticipated 2-3 euro. Though, the previous large workflow cost about this but ran for only 11 files. 
ToDo: Check the logs to ensure tokens aren't being wasted somewhere.
(in typical fashion the o1-responses are twice as long, which explains why they cost 30 x 2 times more than than the gpt-4-mini responses)
(also in the last response with the issue with ALL file references being sent to each individual step, input costs where 1.5x times higher than output costs, 
here they're 0.9x)

Now lets see what I got for my money.

| Writing_ExtensionCheck.py                    | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Works with some modification. Also suggests changes to the rest of the code. In future, the real part of this<br/> will be to somehow split out the exact code that's actually needed with cheap LLM's and feed the key, minimised info in for an expensive LLM |

While there's some evidence gpt-4-mini benefited from the extra context by having a memory of prior tasks, o4-mini did not. Frequent bleed in and confusion. Next time specifically tell it to focus on the task at hand not optimise.

So in light of being able to use every provided solution so far to at least take a shot at implementing the given task if not solve in the majority. I'm switch to a suitably imprecise 5 star review system to look for improvements.
5 stars means I needed to do nothing to implement the LLM's solution
0 star means its solution was completely useless and not a single line or idea could serve as inspiration in looking for the correct solution.
