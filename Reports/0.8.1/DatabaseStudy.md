# Database Study

## User Encyclopedia and Encyclopedia prototypes

Already the system has tried to contextual data on the user in a simple yaml file with very mixed results

There are a series of useful entries which in theory could be quieried to provide additonal context

"occupation": |-
  User works as a Backend Software Developer.
"project": |-
  User is coding a ChatGPT Wrapper hobby project called 'The Thinker'.
...
"watchlater.csv": |-
  A file containing a list of videos or media to watch later, which can be organized by priority on a scale from 1 to 4, where 1 indicates the highest priority and 4 indicates the lowest.
"leisure_watchlater.csv": |-
  A CSV file that organizes leisure activities or media to be watched later, which includes a priority value for each item ranked from 1 to 4.
...
"communication style": |-
  The user seems to prefer verbose or elaborate communication.
...
"priority scale": |-
  A system for ranking items based on their importance or urgency, ranging from 1 (highest priority) to 4 (lowest priority).
...
"user/communication_style": |-
  User has a casual and humorous communication style, as indicated by the phrase 'Whats up doc?'.
"user/react_expertise_level": |-
  User may have a certain level of expertise or interest in React, which could be explored further.

Others however are plainly not useful

"architectural work level": |-
  High amount of architectural work completed.
(Note: For what work?)
...
"string contents": |-
  The textual information associated with each variable name, which can be enhanced or expanded to provide more contextual clues and clearer intentions for their use.
(Note: This is general knowledge not really user knowledge)
...
"user/request": |-
  User has requested to rewrite AiOrchestrator.py and ChatGptWrapper.py for improved documentation.
(Note: Too specific to reserve the term 'request')
...
"user/filenamepreference": |-
  User prefers to name files as file_a.txt and file_b.txt.
(Note: ðŸ˜‘)

However upon closer inspection actually I can see that most entries extract *something* of *some* value

 152 entries (at time of writing)

 59 / 152, ~40% relevant (nevermind a lot are duplicates), (62 / 152 , AI estimate)

 63 / 152, ~40%  duplicated:

    - User knows python: 17 (my estimate), 11 (ai estimate)
    - React Expertise & Frontend Knowledge: 7 (my estimate), 13 (ai estimate)
    - Encyclopedia Management Classes: 9 (this andd the rest are ai)
    - Commit Message Format & Practices: 5
    - Error Handling Preferences: 4
    - Neo4j Knowledge & Interests: 6
    - Project Focus and Goals: 7
    - Daily Schedule & Time Blocking: 5
    - Watchlater & Leisure Prioritization: 6
20 / 152, ~20% Irrelevant/Unfocused

### Conclusion

Now both the key problems: duplicated and Irrelevant/Unfocused entries can be eased by requiring a tighter focus on relationship:
What has, what relation to what concept, which will need to be instantiated as part of addapting creation of user context to a
graph database anyway.

Key points:

- ensure the graph database system has some notion of common terminology and methodology, minimise duplicates and semantic copies
- Configure the ai to think in terms of relationships, the USER -KNOWS- PYTHON, the USER -ASKED- the AI to -IMPROVE- FILE_A,
 USER has a -INTEREST- in PHILOSOPHY, USER has -EXPERIENCE- in
- There must be a system for searching, updating and delting entries
- Keyword detection
- Add a contextual prioritisation, e.g. 'WORKING_ON' gets high priority, 'WORKED_ON' gets low
- Generate summaries and insights based on the graph

Irrelevant: 14 / 33 -> 42% 

A few things pop out right away, principally is the saving of 'unknown data', remembering that we don't know something is
good conceptually, but not with this degree of non-specificity: theres an infinite amount of things the program *doesn't* know.

Secondly many nodes are not relevant or contextual. ``Study duration`` doesn't mean anything outside of the context (which *was*
'how many hours have I studied dutch')
