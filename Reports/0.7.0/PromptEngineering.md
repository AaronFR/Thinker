ChatGpt 4o

1. Full explores the three main sides, lists facts and figures of the debate and ends raises multiple challenging and
 interesting questions
2. Use of interesting explanatory metaphor, explicit challenge to everyday life.
3. Similar but with just a little less panache, another interesting point but not AS challenging as 2
4. One of the worse ChatGpt 4o answers and still really engaging with use of interesting metaphor.

ChatGpt 4o Mini

1. Good, similar to ChatGpt 4o's but with 4 sides, a little weaker but still a good answer
2. Again with 4 sides, adding in the incompatabilist world view. A little challenging but mostly a generic conclusion.
3. Very explanatory but not very challenging rather generic even.
4. Again, not that great. Perfunctory.
