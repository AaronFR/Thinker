### Review
1. Sure? I think for me specifically I'm basically already doing that but its a good suggestion I suppose
2. Irrelevant, not working with others. Understanding design patterns is a *good* suggestion though
3. Good suggestions
4. Reading documentation is an acceptable idea to me
5. Free points for pomodoro, and hey I already am tracking my time
6. I don't have sprints. Avoid perfectionism is probably a response to me saying my biggest issue was just getting stuck in a rut thinking problems over. Decent
7. Related. Good idea, kinda of implemented myself but not too applicable at the minute
8. Interesting, definitely something to think about

100% relevant (To a degree) - of that:
75% Good,
25% Decent

## Conclusion
I will say for the record before comparing point by point they did look about equal with the auto-questioned response maybe being a little more relevant.

Solid improvement, for not all that much extra effort, there where a couple more questions it could have asked but I guess I can't blame it for
presuming that I'm working in a team/company instead of on my own




## Prompt: if adding in questions and answers related to a prompt into the ChatGpt API which would be better in your opinion - concatenating the QA to the user prompt OR including the QA as a prior system or even user message?
ahem

### Augmenting The Prompt
When considering the integration of questions and answers related to a prompt into the ChatGPT API, there are two primary methods to choose from: 

1. **Concatenating the Q&A to the User Prompt**: This approach involves directly appending the question and answer pairs to the user's initial prompt as a single cohesive text block. 

2. **Including the Q&A as Prior System or User Messages**: This method entails inserting the Q&A pairs as separate prior messages in the conversation context, either attributed to the system or the user. 

To evaluate which option might be more effective, consider the following factors:

- **Contextual Clarity**: Does one approach provide clearer context for the model to understand the intent behind the prompt?
- **Response Relevance**: Will the model generate more relevant and accurate responses based on one method compared to the other?
- **Model Behavior**: How might the different formatting impact the model's behavior and the way it processes information?
- **Performance Consistency**: Is there evidence to suggest that one method yields more consistent performance across various prompts and Q&A pairs?

Given these considerations, please analyze which option would likely enhance the interaction quality with the ChatGPT API in your opinion, and provide a rationale for your choice. Remember to support your reasoning with clear, logical steps and reference any relevant data or findings.

  <div>


## Solo Prompt
When integrating questions and answers related to a prompt into the ChatGPT API, both methods have their advantages, but including the Q&A as prior messages (either as a system message or a user message) is generally the better approach. Here’s why:

1. Context Preservation: By using prior messages, the Q&A can be treated as part of the conversational context. This helps the model understand the relevance and intent behind the Q&A, making it more likely to generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses.

2. Improved Clarity: Including Q&A as separate messages clarifies the conversational flow, allowing the model to distinguish between user input and supplementary information. This separation can lead to better response quality as the model has a clearer understanding of what is being asked.

3. Flexibility: By maintaining the Q&A as separate entries, you can adjust or refine them without altering the user prompt directly. This can be useful for iterative testing and optimization.

4. Avoiding Input Length Limitations: Concatenating QA directly into the prompt may increase the risk of exceeding input length limits. By using prior messages, you can better manage the context and ensure the user prompt remains concise.

5. Enhanced Learning: If you plan to use the Q&A to inform future interactions or improve the model's performance, treating them as separate messages may help with training or fine-tuning processes.

Overall, using prior messages for the Q&A will likely yield more effective and nuanced interactions with the ChatGPT API.

<h3>1. <strong>Contextual Clarity</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Concatenating the Q&amp;A to the User Prompt</strong>: This method provides a single, unified context. It allows the model to process the user's prompt along with relevant Q&amp;A as one block of text. This can enhance clarity as the model sees all the information simultaneously.</p></li><li><p><strong>Including the Q&amp;A as Prior System or User Messages</strong>: This approach maintains a more structured conversation history. By treating Q&amp;A as separate messages, the model can retain context over time, potentially leading to a better understanding of the user's ongoing intent.</p></li></ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: If the Q&amp;A directly relates to the user's intent, concatenating may offer more immediate clarity. However, if maintaining context over multiple interactions is critical, using prior messages may be more effective.</p>
<h3>2. <strong>Response Relevance</strong></h3>
<ul><li><p><strong>Concatenating the Q&amp;A</strong>: This method can lead to highly relevant responses if the concatenated context is clear and straightforward. However, it may overwhelm the model if too much information is included, leading to less focused outputs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Including the Q&amp;A as Separate Messages</strong>: This approach allows the model to reference past interactions. It can better understand how the Q&amp;A pairs relate to the current prompt, potentially increasing relevance.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The separate message approach may yield more relevant responses over multiple interactions, while concatenation might work better for single-turn queries.</p><h3>3. <strong>Model Behavior</strong></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Concatenating the Q&amp;A</strong>: This could lead to a more static response generation based on the combined input, as the model treats it as one piece of information. It may also limit the model's flexibility in adjusting its response to the evolving context.</p></li><li><p><strong>Including the Q&amp;A as Prior Messages</strong>: This allows the model to leverage its conversational memory. It can dynamically adjust its understanding and responses based on the progression of the dialogue, which could improve adaptability and creativity.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The separate message format is likely to encourage more dynamic interactions and responsive behavior from the model.</p><h3>4. <strong>Performance Consistency</strong></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Concatenating the Q&amp;A</strong>: Performance may vary based on the size and complexity of the concatenated input. Longer prompts could lead to less consistent outputs, especially if the model struggles to parse extensive information.</p></li><li><p><strong>Including the Q&amp;A as Separate Messages</strong>: This method tends to promote more consistent performance since the model can build on previous interactions without being overwhelmed by too much text in one go.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The separate messages approach generally leads to greater consistency, particularly in extended interactions or complex queries.</p><h3>Overall Recommendation</h3><p>Based on the analysis of the factors above, <strong>including the Q&amp;A as prior system or user messages</strong> is likely the more effective option for enhancing interaction quality with the ChatGPT API. This method offers better contextual clarity over multiple interactions, supports more relevant and accurate responses, fosters dynamic model behavior, and enhances performance consistency.</p><p><strong>Rationale</strong>:</p><ul><li>It allows for a more structured and easily digestible conversation history.</li><li>The model can adapt its responses based on ongoing context, improving the relevance of interactions.</li><li>It promotes better performance across various prompts and interaction lengths.</li></ul><h3>Supporting Data</h3><p>Research and observations in user interactions with conversational models indicate that maintaining an evolving context, rather than presenting large, static inputs, often leads to enhanced understanding and satisfaction. This aligns with practices in dialog systems where managing context and maintaining conversation history is critical to delivering high-quality, user-centered responses.</p></div>

## Augmented Prompt + with questions
"When considering the integration of questions and answers (Q&A) into the ChatGPT API, the choice between concatenating Q&A to the user prompt or including them as prior system or user messages can significantly affect interaction quality. Here's a detailed analysis of both methods based on the specified factors:

### 1. Concatenating the Q&A to the User Prompt

**Advantages**:
- **Simplicity**: This method creates a single cohesive text block, making it straightforward for implementation.
- **Immediate Context**: The model receives all relevant information at once, which may help in generating a unified response that considers the provided Q&A.

**Disadvantages**:
- **Context Overload**: If the Q&A content is extensive, it might overwhelm the user prompt, leading to confusion regarding the main query.
- **Reduced Clarity**: The model might struggle to discern which parts of the concatenated text are most relevant, as everything is bundled together. This can lead to less focused responses.

### 2. Including the Q&A as Prior System or User Messages

**Advantages**:
- **Enhanced Contextual Clarity**: By treating Q&A as distinct prior messages, the model can better understand the conversation's flow and the relevance of each component. It allows the model to process the context in a more structured manner.
- **Response Relevance**: The model can generate responses that are more directly influenced by the preceding conversation context, leading to potentially higher relevant output.
- **Flexibility**: Using system messages can help in setting the context and tone explicitly. For example, a system message can clarify that Q&A is instructional or supplementary to the user's inquiry.

**Disadvantages**:
- **Implementation Complexity**: This approach requires proper handling of message formatting, ensuring that the model can discern and prioritize incoming messages correctly.
- **Context Management**: Care must be taken to manage the flow of conversation, as too many prior messages could lead to a diluting effect where the main user prompt becomes less pronounced.

### Evaluation of Factors

1. **Contextual Clarity**:
   - **Winner**: Including Q&A as prior messages. The separation between messages aids clarity, allowing the user prompt to stand out.

2. **Response Relevance**:
   - **Winner**: Including Q&A as prior messages. Providing comprehensive backgrounds before the main query may enhance response pertinence.

3. **Model Behavior**:
   - Including Q&A as prior messages allows the model to utilize the context effectively without blending it into the user prompt, likely influencing it to generate appropriately tailored responses.

4. **Performance Consistency**:
   - While data on performance variations is not explicitly available, the structured approach of using prior messages is expected to yield more consistent results as it maintains a clearer context flow over multiple interactions.

### Conclusion

Considering the factors of contextual clarity, response relevance, model behavior, and potential performance consistency, **including Q&A as prior system or user messages** emerges as the more effective strategy. This method permits the ChatGPT model to process conversations with enhanced clarity, allowing it to generate better-contextualized and more relevant responses.

In scenarios involving diverse question complexities, such as coding queries, this approach provides adequate nuance and flexibility. Ultimately, it enhances user experience by ensuring that interactions with the ChatGPT API remain engaging, relevant, and accurate, meeting the requirements of various query complexities."

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); gap: 10px;">
  <div>

#### Solo Prompt
Advocates clearly for including as a prior message
Not actually sure point 4 is true. (it isn't)

Makes a decent argument, basically that at the very least its better to separate concerns.


</div>
  <div>

#### Augmented Prompt

Takes a more 'pros and cons' position but then concludes that including as seperate is better.

Really not sure about that performance idea

Seems to assume concatonating to the user messages would be less referable, though I wouldn't want those QA's to be reffered if their not relevant to the new promptp?

Mentions an evolving context but again this isn't relevant to my system, would be *I guess* for the typical chatGpt wrapper system?

Makes an unconvincing case for handling QA as additional user or system messages

</div>
  <div>

#### Augmented Prompt + with questions

- Context overload is a great point
- Flexibility is a good point actually
- Context management is also a good point

Makes a strong, well put case for user and system messages which genuinely convinced me

## Conclusion

1. Augmented Prompt + with questions
2. Original Prompt
3. Augmented Prompt

It's worth mentioning these prompts where generated with ChatGpt 4o- Mini. O1 might provide more logical, correct answers.
As well in this case the questions where generated from the **original** response, next test should see if an augmented prompt leads to better questions being asked

9. Obvious
10. Obvious (though CDN's aren't a bad idea)
11. Meh
12. Obvious but still a good idea
13. Obvious-ish, compliance audits are an un-fun but sound idea

15. Obvious but good ideas are
16. Not a bad idea
17. Obvious
18. Obvious
19. Obvious but fine idea

  <div>

## Augmented Prompt

1. Idea validation + research

a. Understanding pain points is a really good point actually. As far as I understand them for the other ChatGpt wrappers at the moment:
1 unreliability
2  Expensive
3  'disappointing' (no workflows, no schedules, difficult to organise)
4  Unruly and difficult to understand (e.g. what models do what, whats best at what)
5 Only suited for singular prompts rather than continual 1 on 1 communication

b. Done but that's because its a good idea

c. Obvious but good idea

Pitfalls are more focused and 'Suggestions for overcoming' is great

Its actually does show that I could benefit from asking others (more) if they like the idea of my application. 
'Community research' would also be a reasonable use of time eventually

2. Technical Requirements
a. Obvious but valid
b. Obvious but valid
c. Automated invoices is a good idea
d. Obvious but valid
e. Obvious

Pitfalls are on point: Obvious, but valid.
Scalability testing is actually a good idea

3. User Experience

a. I'm actually not doing that (by default) I'm sick of trite, sandblasted applications
b. Simplify sign in: Obvious but a really important point
c. Obvious and planned
d. Obvious

'Complex Interfaces: Overloading users with features can overwhelm them.' Shut up

4. Pricing Strategies

a. obvious, done
b. Don't want to, this manipulative ##it sucks
c. Basically planned
d. Obvious but good

-and it cuts out there, probably failed to grab all of the response 😅
Got the main bit

### Points

3 Really good  14%

10 Good        48%

5 Obvious      24%

3 Annoying     14%

### Conclusion

Seemingly more obvious and trite than the original prompt but it did have some genuinely good ideas too

</div>
  <div>

## Augmented Prompt + with questions

1. Good. VAT and sales tax are good point. Action steps are useful too
2. Good, OWASP Top Ten is a really good point, and I didn't even know there where security libraries for React and Flask
3. Decent but basically just repeating what I told it I would do
4. Just repeating what I told it. 
"For relational data, SQL databases might be more efficient." In what context? Speed alone? Sure but that's not really the point.
Suggesting Heroku or AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a pretty good suggestion though
5. Decent points
6. Obvious
7. Good (Was going to award 'decent' despite giving good to this same point in the original prompt, so there you *do* get desensitised to these answers)
8. Obvious
9. Partnerships is a good idea
10. Financial projects are a good idea
11. Decent, makes sense
12. Good. Educating users is an important and often neglected aspect

Eh, seems fine though no really strong points but that's probably because they've already been suggested.

### Points

2 Really good           15%

5 Good                  40%

2 Decent                15%

2 Obvious               15%

2 Repeating user input  15%



</div>
</div>

### Notable Points

#### Original

1. CCPA or PCI DSS
2. bcrypt + Argon2, session management and RBAC
3. CDN's aren't a bad idea
4. Knowledge base and support channels

#### Augmented

1. 'Understand pain points'
2. Don't assume demand
3. Engage with communities - 'Community research' would also be a reasonable use of time eventually
4. Automated invoices
5. Scalability testing
6. Simplify sign in

#### Augmented with questions

1. OWASP Top Ten
2. Security libraries for React and Flask
3. Heroku or AWS Elastic Beanstalk for hosting flask/python
4. Partnerships
5. Financial projection are a good idea
6. Educating user



### Conclusion
Original            60% (above 'fine')
Augmented           62%
Augmented with QA   70%

Augmented was a real mixed bag, despite containing some of the best points -it also included the worst most annoying ones

Augmented with QA comes out on top by a narrow margin- but this is a single test and its a highly subjective, variable and informal method for reviewing prompts
against one another, so we shouldn't look too far into that.

Less clear than the prior original prompt what's superior (ironically)

The augmented prompt with Q&A was more specific - a little, but it also contained regurgitation's of user input which is annoying to read.

Still if you focus on 'obviousness' there's a clear drop along each step so there is *some* value in this specific case.
