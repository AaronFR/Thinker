Tips
- When creating a react app the application should have informed the user to run a command like npx create-react-app to build the program. Not try and do it themselves/yourself.
- Think through architectural decisions. E.g. frontend is complicated rather than just saying add a router to the App.js page
 state that it should be added to an index.html preferably
- If you have a fault program and you ask the ai: "this is my code, this is the problem, what do you suggest" it can run
 in loops forever if its solution doesn't work or clashes with other pieces of code. If you ask instead "I am trying to create an X"
 how are X's typically created? How do they approach problem Y specifically?" This can avoid these types of clashes and provide
 a well rounded solution from the get go.
