Much to eager to suggest try catch improvements to EVERYTHING, perhaps with greater oversight the application will stop
but creating a coder role that understand this convertion would be an improvement


ChatGpt is trained to process questions written in output - this is potential disastrous if NOTHING else than to the
establish flow dictated by the preset instructions for a given persona

Utilise chains of user prompts and observations to analyse difficult, hard problems (new role)

ChatGpt is HYPER focused on completing pair, docstring comments for instance. It is irrelevant how many times you tell it
to NOT add docstring comments: it will.
Trying to give ChatGpt half a 'structual element' is a recipe for distaster. Needs to decompose a file/class into its
components.
